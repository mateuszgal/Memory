# Memory
Memory game
I first encountered programming in the sixth grade of primary school, it was Turbo Pascal.
I learned from a course found on the internet. I got hooked on programming again as part of a computer science class in middle school. 
Inspired by the game development classes in Scratch, I started learning C# to be able to create games in the Unity3D environment. 
However, due to a lack of people with whom I could share this interest, I gave up after a while. 
In high school, I was exposed to C++ as part of my computer science classes, but at that point I was more interested in physics.
Years later I came to the conclusion that programming has always given me a lot of pleasure, but I didn't know how to turn this interest into a profession. 
That is why I think that Motorola academy is a great opportunity for me
